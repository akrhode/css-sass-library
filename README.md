# css-sass-library

Single-page responsive CSS/SASS library built with SCSS and Gulp to practice using SASS fundamentals, such as setting up a project structure, creating variables, connecting partials, and importing modules. It also includes nesting, loops, conditionals, maps, parent selectors, mixins, functions, utility classes, media queries, extend, !default, and creating a responsive grid system. Unused classes are watched and purged using PurgeCSS.
